# CANSSI-NCSC-Ferry-Delays  -- Kaggle Competition

This Kaggle challenge is about predicting ferry delays in BC Ferry sailings around Vancouver harbours.

This repo refers to the solution I provided. Please follow this link for further information on the challenge and the data (https://www.kaggle.com/c/canssi-ncsc-ferry-delays/overview)

# Result 

In this Kaggle challenge **I managed to finish at position 15**. However, looking back on my solution, with more time I would have been able to improve my results by doing more in depth feature engineering. Also, I would have corrected for the overfitting !
